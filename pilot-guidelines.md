# CIO Slack Pilot - Guidelines and Introduction to Slack

## Why Slack?

Since 2018, Treasury Board has supported the use of Slack throughout the GC for non-sensitive real-time messaging and collaboration 

As anyone is able to freely make workspaces and invite colleagues to their workspace, the tool has risen dramatically in popularity across the GC.

As we work towards equipping the GC workforce with Collaboration Tools, we want to ensure we’re evaluating all the tools that people WANT to use.


## What is the purpose of the Pilot?

Overall, the intent will be to learn about Slack from actual users. We want to share our experiences to help determine if procuring paid licenses for Slack is something we should be considering for SSC.


We will assess a number of things, such as:
* Overlaps with O365
* How Slack impacts your day - did it bring value? was it a distraction?
* Accessibility
* Security
* User experience on work and personal devices
* How is Slack being used in other Departments (Transport Canada, Canadian Digital Services, Natural Resources Canada)


## Pilot volunteer expectations

**Thank you for volunteering!**

As volunteers, we have a few expectations and instructions to ensure that this pilot is a success:
* Create an account for Slack and actively coordinate with the members of your team to participate
* Contribute to the public channels on a consistent basis and that you use Slack on a daily basis.
* Provide us with feedback, suggestions and ideas at any time in the #cio-office channel
* Answer survey(s) and participate in any feedback sessions organized through the pilot

## Slack Code of Conduct

Because this is a free slack account, we have limited history, but Slack - the company - retains complete logs of all channels and direct message.

Slack is a U.S. company and therefore data is held in the U.S. and subject to their laws. All communication in slack is strictly limited non-sensitive data only.

We want this to be a fun, pleasant, and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.
