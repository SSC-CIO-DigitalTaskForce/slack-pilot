# Slack Analysis - OGD Questions

We will be meeting with various OGDs to discuss their use of Slack, in order to learn and document some current best practices in use across the GC.

In order to prepare for those meetings, we need to develop a list of questions relevant to our Pilot.


1.  How long have you been using Slack in your Department?
2.	How is adoption? (Onboarding, activity, etc)
3.	What tools were you using before Slack? What has been the major differences - good or bad? 
4.	Do people use/prefer other tools similar to slack? 
5.	Did Slack impact employee engagement. morale and efficiency in your team/department?  
6.  Are you using the free version, or have you paid for licenses?
7.	Did you implement any security or risk mitigation measures?
8.  Did you do any training, or engagement sessions for slack users?
9.	On a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being « not recommended », 10 being « absolutely recommended », how much would you recommend Slack? Why?
